# 🧠 AI for Medical Imaging Bootcamp

Welcome to the **AI for Medical Imaging Bootcamp**, a self-paced introduction to building intelligent systems that analyze, interpret, and learn from medical images.  
This bootcamp combines foundational AI concepts with hands-on modules that guide you from data preprocessing to segmentation, biomarker discovery, and report generation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this bootcamp is to help you:
- Understand the **core principles** of AI in medical imaging.  
- Learn how to design and implement **end-to-end imaging workflows**.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **open-source tools** such as PyRadiomics, MERLIN, nnU-Net, and TotalSegmentator.  
- Build confidence to contribute to research in the **BioIntelligence Lab** or launch your own imaging AI projects.
